                            <l1><h4>1. Prepare the Sugar Syrup:</h4>
Mix sugar, water, and crushed cardamom in a pan. <br> Boil and simmer until the syrup is slightly sticky but not reaching one-string consistency.
<br>Remove from heat, add rose water and lemon juice, and keep warm.
<br><h4> 2. Make the Dough:</h4>
<br>In a bowl, mix milk powder, flour, and baking powder well.
<br>Add ghee and mix until crumbly.
<br>Gradually add milk and gently combine to make a soft, smooth dough.<br> Avoid kneading too much, as it can make jamuns hard.<br> Dough should be slightly sticky but hold shape.
<br>For khoya dough, mash khoya and paneer well, add semolina, flour, baking powder, and cardamom, then gently mix with milk to form dough.
<br><h4> 3. Shape the Jamuns:</h4>
<br>Divide dough into small equal portions (about 20g each).
<br>Grease your palms lightly with ghee or oil and roll the dough pieces into smooth, crack-free balls.<br> Avoid cracks to prevent breaking while frying.
<br> <h4>4.Frying:</h4>
<br>Heat ghee or oil on medium-low flame; it should be hot but not smoking.
<br>Test the oil by dropping a small dough piece â€“ it should slowly rise to the surface.
<br>Fry a few balls gently, turning slowly for even golden brown color, about 4-6 minutes.<br> Avoid overcrowding.
<br>Remove and drain on paper towels.
<br><h4>5.Soak Jamuns:</h4>
<br>Immediately place fried jamuns into the warm sugar syrup.
<br>Let them soak for at least 2-3 hours (or overnight for best softness) to absorb syrup and become juicy and tender.

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                        
                          <br><l1>Full-fat milk (for making fresh chenna/paneer)</l1>
                          <br> <l1> Acidic agent (lemon juice, vinegar, or curd) to curdle milk</l1>
                          <br> <l1>Sugar (for syrup and sweetened milk) </l1>
                          <br> <l1> Cardamom powder and saffron strands (for flavoring) </l1>
                           <br> <l1> Nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews) for garnish</l1>
                          <br>  <l1> Optional: rose water or kewra essence for aromatic flavor.</l1>

                        <h4>Recipe</h4>
                        <ol> 
                           <l1><h4> Step 1: Preparing Chenna (Paneer)</h4>
<br>Boil full-fat milk and curdle it by adding lemon juice or vinegar gradually while stirring.
<br>Once curdled, drain using a muslin cloth,<br> rinse with cold water to remove sourness and stop cooking.
<br>Squeeze out excess water but keep the chenna slightly moist and soft.
<br>Hang the cloth for 30 to 60 minutes to drain further whey.
<br>Knead the chenna gently until smooth and non-sticky; <br>avoid over-kneading to prevent hardness.
<h4>Step 2: Shaping and Cooking the Chenna Discs.</h4>
<br>Divide the kneaded chenna into equal parts, <br>roll into balls, <br>and gently flatten into discs.
<br>Prepare a boiling sugar syrup (water and sugar,<br> flavored with cardamom).
<br>Add the chenna discs carefully into the boiling syrup, <br>cover and cook on medium flame for about 7 to 10 minutes until they puff up and double in size.
<br>Remove and let them rest in the syrup for 20-30 minutes,<br> then gently squeeze out excess syrup.
<h4>Step 3: Preparing the Rabri (Flavored Thickened Milk)</h4>
<br>Boil full-fat milk in a heavy pan, stirring continuously and scraping malai (cream) from the sides.
<br>Cook until the milk reduces to approximately half its original volume, forming rabri.
<br>Add sugar, saffron, cardamom powder, and soaked saffron milk.
<br>Stir in chopped nuts and optionally rose water or kewra essence for aroma.
<h4>Step 4: Assembling Rasmalai</h4>
<br>Soak the cooked and syrup-squeezed chenna discs into the warm rabri.
<br>Let them absorb the flavored milk for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
 <br>Garnish with slivered pistachios and almonds, and serve chilled.
<h4> Tips for Perfect Rasmalai :</h4>
<br>Use full-fat or whole milk for creamy texture and richness.
<br>Adding ice-cold water immediately after curdling stops further cooking, keeping chenna soft.
<br>Do not over-knead chenna; just smooth it enough to remove graininess.
<br>The sugar syrup should be boiling when you add chenna discs for even puffing.
<br>Cook chenna discs covered to trap steam and keep them soft.
<br>Simmer rasgulla discs in rabri only for a couple of minutes; overcooking makes them hard or break.
<br>Soaking in rabri for several hours enhances flavor and juiciness.
<br>You can use store-bought fresh rasgulla as a shortcut by squeezing out syrup and soaking them in flavored milk.
